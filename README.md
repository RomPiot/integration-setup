# Integration Setup

Let's go!

## Installation
```
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Configuration
To override the configuration, copy and paste the .env.example file and rename it to .env, and edit the values.

## Start the server
```
yarn start
```

By default, without custom configuration, go to: `http://localhost:3001`
